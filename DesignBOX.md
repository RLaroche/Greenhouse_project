Let's start the 3D design part !

Here we explain the 3D design part of the box to welcome our complete system.
She took a lot of time and you will understand why.

To summarize: We must be able to contain in our box the PCB and all its associated components.
That is to say, think of the LCD screen but also all sensors by providing a space for each of them so that they can be usable and effective in their measurements. In addition, it also requires the power supply with its LIPO card which is connected to a battery and a photovoltaic panel that makes our system autonomous.

We imagine a first box that will contain the PCB, all the sensors, the screen and the LIPO card connected to the battery. It is obviously necessary to foresee a specific place for the LCD screen, the light sensor (if it is hidden or on the side it will not receive the real light), for the temperature sensor, for the DHT22 it is necessary that it can measure the value close to the plant and without forgetting the grove moisture sensor which must have a contact with the direct earth. We do not forget the hole to connect the antenna to the module sigfox and another hole to pass the son of the photovoltaic panels to the map LIPO.

Here is the main box:

We need a part to accommodate the photovoltaic panel and connect the panel to the LIPO board.

Here is the result :

We must be able to close this wonderful box!

Here is the adapted lid:

As we can see, this is a lid that has teeth that come inside the main box for better stability.

Here is when we add it on our wonderful box:

To gain resistance is added a sliding door which is introduced in the box but also in the lid which holds the two parts in a rigorous manner and provides reliability and of the security of components inside.

Here is the first version of sliding door:

To go even further, we thought to incorporate the photovoltaic module to the main box, so that it is at the same level as light sensor and its strategic position and to feel that the autonomous system is something of 'United.

Here is the second version of the sliding door with the possibility to clip the photovoltaic module previously presented:

Here is when we add it on our wonderful box which already has its superb lid:

You're a little lost ?
Let us show you what is the final state of this magic box!

(Damage that we could not print it for now thanks to the 3D printer because I was asked for robustness, something I did, but I must believe that I have a little too much, in fact of the thickness being greater than 4mm , so I was not able to print it because would took to much material, too sad) ... But it is not too late for print it, at least if only for pleasure = D

So beautiful :
